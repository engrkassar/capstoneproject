# Project Definition


## Project Overview:

This is capstone project for Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Program, a student could choose from many diverse projects to complete the nano degree. I chose this challenging project, because it is common for business in this digital age to have similar challenges in the data they collect in apps, which is how actually the customer is responding to offers. The data is provided by Starbucks, it contain all the required features to measure their reward program performance.

## 
## Problem Statement:

The outcome for this project is clear: to determine what offer best suited to which demographic group. First, I have to determine what makes an offer successful, I have settled on this criteria: an offer to be successful it must be received then viewed then completed by the same user during the offer allowed duration. If the offer is discount or BOGO, the user must have made a purchase in the date of the completion.


## 
## Metrics:

The only metric I will use is to identify what is the demographic to target with which offer.

## Thanks:

Special thanks to MISK, Udacity, Starbucks for giving me this opportunity.
